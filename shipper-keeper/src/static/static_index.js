export const shipper_keeper =`ShipperKeeper is designed by keeping the focus on the consumer, giving them the choice they deserve. ShipperKeeper brings the online and physical world together to make it a seamless experience for the consumer. Irrespective of where they purchase a product, they would have a meaninful human experience in the whole process. You order online or buy items in a store, you can pick both of them at the same time and drop off items in a nearby store of convinience. Soon they will have the choice to pay with cash at the local store that they normally buy as they pickup the items. We can bring the focus back to the local mom and pop store and create a thriving local economy.`;
export const our_solution = `ShipperKeeper solution is simple. The consumer orders a product online and chooses the local store of choice to pickup the product. The buyer is notified when the product reaches the local store, next time they are in their neighborhood store, they can pickup the item along with anything else they buy. They could do the samething if they are buying a gift for someone, they can choose a store close to where they are gifting and show up with the gift as a surprise. The sametime the consumer chooses a local store, they would be notified of the expected delivery. ShipperKeeper solution offers choice for the consumer, a quick physical presence for the online business and additional much needed foot-traffic to the local business. We strive to put the Buzz back to the local economy. `;
export const our_purpose = `Hardly a moment goes by, without you reading something about an online business siphoning off the local economy. We strongly believe, it is not a zero sum game. There is more in for everyone of us not just to survive but to thrive if we put our heads together. Having an online business is not easy, you don't know your customer, you need to worry about supply-chain, logistics, employees and so much more. Having a local physical store is not easy either, you need to be in the right location, need to have the right product, having just-in-time inventory is hard and above all you need customers. We at ShipperKeeper felt that this could be turned in to a symbiotic relationship between the local businesses, online business and the consumer by building the circle-of-trust. The consumers know their neighborhood, their neighbors run the local businesses. By ordering and picking up from the local store, they can buy other convinience items from the store and they trust their local owner. They can drop off any product returns to their online purchases with their local store owner. Above all this symbiotic relationship brings the buzz back to the main street. We can revive and make the local economy thrive again.`;
